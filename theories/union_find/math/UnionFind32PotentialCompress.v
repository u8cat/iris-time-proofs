(* Assume [x] and [y] both have non-zero rank and both have a parent. Assume
   that there is a non-trivial path from [x] to [y]. Finally, assume that [x]
   and [y] have the same level, i.e., [k x = k y]. Write [kk] for this common
   level. Then, [iter (1 + i x) (A kk) (K x)] is at most [K (p y)]. This
   technical lemma appears in the last paragraph of Tarjan's course notes. *)

Lemma kx_ky:

  k F K y = kk ->
  iter (1 + i F K x) (A kk) (K x) <= K (p F y).
Proof using is_rdsf_F.

  (* Because there is a path from the parent of [x] to [y], the rank of [y]
     is at least the rank of the parent of [x]. *)

  (* By definition of [k], applying [A kk] to [K y] takes us at
     least to [K (p y)]. Another way of seeing this would be say
     that the previous assertion holds for [y] too, and [i y] is
     at least 1. *)
  assert (hy: A kk (K y) <= K (p F y)).
  { rewrite <- hky. k betaf_spec_direct. }
  (* Together, the above inequalities imply that iterating [1 + i x] times
     [A kk], starting from [K x], takes us at most to [K (p y)]. Which is
     our goal. *)

(* Under the same hypotheses as the previous lemma, if one performs path
   compression by installing an edge from [x] to its representative [z],
   then either [k x] changes (which means it increases, really, but we
   have not yet proved that), or [i x] increases. *)

  1 + i F K x <= i (compress F x z) K x.
Proof using is_rdsf_F.
  introv ? ? ? ? hkx hky ? hkk.
  (* Because there is a path from [x] to the parent of [y], the
     representative of the parent of [y] must be [z]. This implies
     an inequality between the ranks of these vertices. *)
