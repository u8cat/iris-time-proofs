(* In general, one can prove:
 *     if the translated program with the counter initialized to m is safe,
 *     then the source program is m-safe.
 * This is lemma [adequate_translation__nadequate] in `Simulation.v`.
 *
 * Moreover, for time credits, we can prove:
 *     if the translated program with the counter initialized to m is safe,
 *     then the source program computes in at most m steps.
 * This is lemma [safe_tctranslation__bounded] in `TimeCredits.v` (it relies
 * crucially on the unsafe behavior of “tick” for time credits).
 *
 * However, the combination of both results does not imply that the source
 * program is safe, because m-safety only describe sequences of reductions of
 * length strictly less than m, so we cannot tell what happens for sequences
 * of length exactly m.
 *
 * In `TimeCredits.v`, this is solved by proving that (roughly):
 *     if the Hoare triple  { TC m } «e» { φ }  holds,
 *     then FOR ALL m' ≥ m,
 *       the translated program with the counter initialized to m' is safe.
 * This is lemma [spec_tctranslation__adequate_translation] in `TimeCredits.v`.
 *
 * Hence from the Hoare triple we can deduce that the source program
 *   (1)  computes in at most m steps (by taking m' = m), and
 *   (2)  is (m+1)-safe (by taking m' = m+1),
 * which is enough to conclude that it is completely safe.
 *
 * However, this is not completely natural, because deducing (2) amounts to
 * giving the translated program one credit more than required.
 *
 * In fact, exploiting the unsafe behavior of “tick”, we can prove that:
 *     if the translated program with the counter initialized to m is safe,
 *     then the source program is safe.
 * The proof is given below. It is mostly a copy-paste of the general proof
 * of [adequate_translation__nadequate] in `Simulation.v`, with additional calls
 * to [safe_tctranslation__bounded] and one call to [not_safe_tick].

(* On the contrary, it is possible to get rid of the dependency upon the unsafe
 * behavior of “tick”.
 *
 * The fact that, for time credits, “tick” crashes when the counter is depleted,
 * is essential to prove the operational version of the main result: that the
 * safety of a translated program implies an upper bound on the running time of
 * the source program (lemma [safe_tctranslation__bounded] in `TimeCredits.v`).
 *
 * However, it is redundant from the logical point of view: because we give a
 * time credit to “tick” (in its Hoare specification [tick_spec]), the counter
 * is guaranteed not to be exhausted, and the crashing branch is dead code.
 *
 * Hence we may as well implement “tick” with a mere decrementation, whatever
 * the value of the counter is. If we do so, then we can strenghten the
 * simulation lemma as such:
 *     if (t₁, σ₁) reduces to (t₂, σ₂) in n steps,
 *     then for all (relative) integer m,
 *       («t₁», «σ₁»[ℓ:=m]) reduces to («t₂», «σ₂»[ℓ:=m−n]).
 * In other words, there is no need anymore for the initial value m of the
 * counter to be at least equal to n.
 *
 * Then, for that modified implementation of “tick”, we can prove:
 *     if the Hoare triple  { TC m } «e» { φ }  holds,
 *     then the source program computes in at most m steps.
 *
 * Whereas the proof which relies on the crashing behavior uses [wp_adequacy]
 * (the fact that the WP predicate is sound, that is, implies the safety/adequacy
 * of the program), this proof uses [wp_invariance] instead (the fact that the
 * WP predicate preserves invariants of the program).
 *
 * The idea of the proof is as follows: given a n-step reduction from (t₁, σ₁)
 * to (t₂, σ₂), the strenghtened simulation lemma gives a reduction from
 * («t₁», «σ₁»[ℓ:=m]) to («t₂», «σ₂»[ℓ:=m−n]). The invariant of time credits
 * in the final state implies that m−n is a non-negative integer; otherwise
 * said, n ≤ m.
